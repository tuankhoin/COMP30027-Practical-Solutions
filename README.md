# COMP30027 Practical Solutions
Welcome!
 
Upon requests from my students, this will be where I put my teaching materials for UniMelb Course [COMP30027 - Machine Learning](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp30027). They are Jupyter Notebooks from practical sessions, slightly modified by me. 

All the original credits go to Kris, Hasti and the COMP30027 Teaching Team. Have fun - Khoi.

Some quick stuffs:
- I have added on each notebook a button so that you can run them on Colab if you want.
- If you like it, give the repo a star so that I look cooler on my GitHub profile ;) .
